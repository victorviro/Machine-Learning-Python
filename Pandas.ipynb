In the example shown, the values in the outermost level (State) are sorted first, followed by the values in the City level, and then finally the values in the Street level.\n",

If we want to vary up the sort order for different levels, the `ascending` parameter accepts a list of Booleans. Each Boolean represents the sort order for the level in the MultiIndex, starting with the outermost one and proceeding inwards. If the length of the list passed to the ascending parameter is less than the number of levels in the MultiIndex, then any remaining levels will keep their original sort order. For example, an argument of `[False, False]` will sort the State and City levels in descending order, and the Street level in ascending order.\n",
